== Foreword

As I could defeat a couple of hubpress problems or at least circumvent them, I decided at the end, after testing kinda all the themes, that I don't like them.
I had some problem with every one of them. Every one of them has some pros and cons, but I was not fully satisfied with any of them.

Besides, I haven't found any site, where I could check some kind of preview how they look like in action.

This write will give you that:

Pictures about the hubpress themes, and some highly subjective comparison.

So my idea is: I'll make a list here, with screenshots, and descriptions of every theme, and write down what is I like about that theme, and why I don't like it.

== casper

This is the _default_ theme.

Pros:

* Nice opening page
* The font is kinda readble and large enough, not tireing my eyes
* Facebook share link
* Twitter share link
* Status bar showing the reading percent on the top of the screen

Cons:

* The content is centered. Everything is in the middle of the page. If you resize your browser horizontally, the text not growing with it. I don't like that! -> _showstopper_
* No G+ share -> _showstopper_
* No tags management -> _showstopper_
* RSS links to feedly instead of the site's own rss -> _showstopper_, maybe easy to fix
* The share links on the top of the screen only appear, when you scroll down into the content!
* No explicit share icons at the end of the blog entry where the share usually are

I think, the thinking process is this:

* Read an article
* Decide if I like that
* Share
* Maybe comment

The share happens *after* I've read the article. So the share button should be below the article IMHO.

== ghostium

Pros:

* Tab bar on the opening page
* Tags handling
* Facebook share link
* Twitter share link
* G+ share link
* Working xml link to rss feed

Cons:

* Opening page cuts an interesting part of my cover pic, and not in a good way
* No status bar of reading percentage
* Content is focused in the middle of the page
* Coverpic not working on the entries (`:hp-image:`) _showstopper_ I found so nice cover pics for the topics! :D

== ichi

Pros:

* Nice-ish opening page, except the tab bar is on the right side. IMHO It's irrational for those who read left to right.
* Nice namecard-ish part at the end of the post, with nice sharing icons
* Tag handling
* Nice Namecardish thing at the bottom of the entries. I love them.
* Also really nice share buttons

Cons:

* No coverpic at the blog entries
* No rss link
* Only a handsome of the social media links appears on the opening page
* Puts a bunch of disfunctional links to the opening page. I mean, I don't mind the _home_ or the _about_ icon. But if there is no that kind of content in the repo, let me give an opportunity to disable them.

== roon

Disgusting opening page!!!

Pros:

* rss link on the opening page
* Working cover pic

Cons:

* This opening page is a horror!
* Style is not bad, but... Nothing impressive. To much square.
* No tags! _showstopper_

== the-shell

It's almost a winner. Kinda nice, but...

Pros:

* Nice opening page
* tags are working
* shareing icons for Twitter, Faceboog, G+

Cons:

* The usual centered style
* No rss link
* No social media links
* The shareing icons are after the disqus section... I would change the order!

== uno

Nice opening page, but practically disfunctional...
I could make screenshots via direct links, but I won't spend much more time with a disfunctional theme.

== uno-zen

I think I kinda stay with this, even if it has some really bugging problem...

Pros:

* Nice Opening page
* Clean-ish design
* Nice, and readable fonts
* Grows with the browser width! This was the only one!
* Nice social media icon set. Practically, I saw everything what I configured on the settings page!
* Working tags!

Cons:

* Finding out how to open the opening page, could be tricky, if you don't know where to click :)
* No media share icons at the entries. In other circumstances I would say, it's a showstopper, but... Since this was the only one, which follow nicele the browser's width, It won!
* Kinda too bright. Even the opening page, and everything else looks like overexposed, or if the picture would have been taken with a very high ISO value.

== summary

As I said in the foreword, there are small annoying things in every theme. But finally I stayed at uno-zen. On the long term, if I could combine uno zen's closing, with the ichi theme's namecard+ shareing icon section, that would be my allwinner.
Maybe, I liked _The Shell_ 's font and style a little bit better, but the centered style and missing coverpic on the entries are also showstoppers.
